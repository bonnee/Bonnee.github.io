# Hi!

I'm Matteo, a computer engineer with a passion for mobility, photography and everything that computes. I like to make stuff with electronics and 3D printers. I self-host a [gallery](https://gallery.bonnee.me) of my favourite pictures. Have a look at my [Î¼blog](https://t.me/bonnys_space) on Telegram (italian only, sorry).
