My name is Matteo Bonora, I'm a graduate student in Computer Engineering at [PoliTO](https://www.polito.it).

During my bachelor studies I was part of [E-Agle Trento Racing Team](https://eagletrt.it/) where I covered the role of Software Chief Technician for the 2020 and 2021 season. My work focused on high-voltage battery management software on which I wrote my [bachelor thesis](https://github.com/Bonnee/bms-development).

While programming microcontrollers for E-Agle I discovered my interest for embedded devices and electronics.

In my spare time I like dumpster-diving in search of old stuff.
