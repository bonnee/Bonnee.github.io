My friend [Simone](https://simoneruffini.github.io/) found this gem of a dot-matrix [Vacuum Fluorescent Display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_fluorescent_display) when tearing down his parents' old car.
The only datasheet we could find was locked in a [shitty vBulletin forum](https://www.digital-kaos.co.uk/forums/showthread.php/59335-repair-dashboard-scenic-2?p=4106838&viewfull=1#post4106838) that not only required an account in order to open a damn file, but also demanded an user introduction post. So I decided to sign up so you don't have to.

Fuck them, here's the datasheet: [GP1095A01A.pdf](GP1095A01A.pdf)

Bonus [link](https://bit.ly/QuantumCAN) for all VFD junkies.
